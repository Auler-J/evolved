\title{Simulating generations of genetic drift in a Wright–Fisher (WF) population}
\usage{
WFDriftSim(
  Ne,
  nGen,
  p0 = 0.5,
  nSim = 1,
  plot_type = "animate",
  printData = FALSE,
  knitr = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ne}{Number giving the effective population size of the population}

\item{nGen}{Number of generations to be simulated.}

\item{p0}{Initial frequency of a given allele. As the simulated organism is
diploid, the other alleles frequency will be \code{1-(p0)}. Default value
is \code{0.5}.}

\item{nSim}{Number of simulations to be made. If decimals are inserted,
they will be rounded. Default value is \code{1}.}

\item{plot_type}{Character indicating if simulations should be plotted as colored
lines. Each color represents a different population. If
\code{plot_type = "animate"} (default value) it animates each generation
individually. If \code{plot_type = "static"} it plots all lines rapidly. If
\code{plot_type = "none"} nothing is plotted.}

\item{printData}{Logical indicating whether all simulation results should be
returned as a \code{data.frame}. Default value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{knitr}{Logical indicating if plot is intended to show up in RMarkdown files made by the \code{Knitr} R package.}
}
\value{
If \code{plot_type = "static"} or \code{"animate"}, plots the
timeseries of all simulations, with each line+color referring to a
different simulation. Note that if many simulations (generally more
than 20) are simulated, colors might be cycled and different simulation
will have the same color. If \code{printData = TRUE}, returns a
\code{data.frame} with the simulation results.
}
\description{
\code{WFDriftSim} simulates genetic drift of diploid Wright–Fisher
populations with a given effective population size through a certain number of
generations.
}
\details{
The effective population size (\code{Ne}) is strongly connected
with the rate of genetic drift (for details, see Waples, 2022).
}
\examples{
#Default values:
WFDriftSim(Ne = 5, nGen = 30)

#A population which has already fixed one of the alleles:
WFDriftSim(Ne = 5, nGen = 30, p0=1)

#Many populations::
WFDriftSim(Ne = 5, nGen = 30, p0=0.2, nSim=10)

######## continuing a previous simulation:
ngen_1stsim <- 10 # number of gens in the 1st sim:
sim1 <- WFDriftSim(Ne = 5, nGen = ngen_1stsim, p0=.2, nSim=10, 
plot_type = "none", printData = TRUE)
ngen_2ndsim <-15 # number of gens in the 2nd sim:
# now, note how we assigned p0:
sim2 <- WFDriftSim(Ne = 5, nGen = ngen_2ndsim, p0=sim1[,ncol(sim1)], 
plot_type = "static", nSim=10, printData = TRUE)

# if we want to merge both simulations, then we have to:
# remove first column of 2nd sim (because it repeats
# the last column of the 1st sim)
sim2 <- sim2[,-1]

# re-name 2nd sim columns:
colnames(sim2) <- paste0("gen", (ngen_1stsim+1):(ngen_1stsim+ngen_2ndsim))

#finally, merging both rounds of simulations:
all_sims <- cbind(sim1, sim2)
head(all_sims)
